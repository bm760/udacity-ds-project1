### Topic: Predicting Ratings for Dialysis Facilities in the United States 

### Motivation: With healthcare costs skyrocketing, it is more important than ever for patients have the information they need to make the right decision regarding their health.  Dialysis in particular is a medical service where many different providers can offer nearly identical services, so giving patients the transparency into ratings information can allow patients to choose facilities that give them the best possible health outcomes. The data from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provides potentially useful but unwieldy information regarding Dialysis facilities across the United States, but with some clean up and modeling, we can use this data to understand how the ratings work, if they are related to actual patient health outcomes, and if there are other factors besides patient health outcomes at play in a facility's rating.  Businesses that work with Dialysis facilities may also be interested in this transparency, as they either aim to improve existing facilities, open new ones, or look to work along with the current players in the Dialysis facility marketplace.
